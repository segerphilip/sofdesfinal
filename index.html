							<h2>The Team</h2>
							<p>The members of this group are Shrinidhi Thirumalai, Bonnie Ishiguro, Hannah Wilk, Philip Seger, and Austin Greene. Currently, we see ourselves as one big group of five working together to create one video game. However, if we split up into subgroups, each focused on a different part of the project, we plan to integrate these groups together for our final game. Our project will be on the github repo: <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fsegerphilip%2Fsofdesfinal&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEjVMLGJsmb6bg5VCsFwXl0Psd3Ag">github.com/segerphilip/sofdesfinal.</a> Since this project is focused on a video game with an artificial intelligence component, we may have some computation that overlaps with the coursework from Mechanics, a class four members of our group are currently taking. We don’t currently see any other significant overlaps.
							</p><br>
							<h2>The Project</h2>
							<p>
							We plan to create a 2D video game with a machine learning component. We would like our video game to have a dynamic storyline with multiple endings that gets harder as the player progresses.  Our minimum deliverable would be a functional game with an AI component. In essence, we want a user to enjoy the game and have fun, but we would still like to be able to add more features down the road. Once our minimum deliverable is finished, we plan to make our game available online, have a dynamic storyline, and perhaps have a multi-player option. Because of the team size, there are quite a few components that will be dealt with in subteams. This includes, but is not currently limited to, building a custom website, having player models and environment graphics, interesting game mechanics, adaptive storyline influenced by the user’s decisions, and machine learning which would define how one progresses through the game. This would be quite a lot of work, so splitting it would help keep everything manageable and teach the group how to properly interface with one another so the code can be easily integrated together.
							</p><br>
							<h2>The Plan</h2>
							<p>
							To get started, we first have to figure out the storyline and mechanics of our game. Once this is done, we can then create a skeleton code of basic functions, classes, and objects that we can then assign to our group members. We plan to make our naming conventions, variable names, and inputs and outputs very clear in our skeleton code to allow for easy group coding and collaboration. Our current looming question to answer is: “What is our game?”. This entails determining the game mechanics, story, and the expected user-experience. The biggest problem we currently foresee is efficient integration of code from our members into a coherent project. Since we have a large group of five people, we need to make sure there are large significant separate chunks to our project. We currently see game mechanics, custom branching of storylines, machine learning, graphics, and website design as separate coding parts of our project.
							</p><br>
							<p>
							We don’t foresee the need for an assigned advisor outside of the computation space because our project is not intensely interdisciplinary. However, whenever we have questions, we will ask help from our class NINJAS and attend NINJA hours outside of class time as well. We are looking for an advisor who has experience in machine learning and/or video games and is willing to help us.

						<h2>Pyglet vs. Pygame</h2>
						<p>
							One fundamental issue that our team encountered in the beginning of the project was the libraries that we were planning on using. While pygame provides a lot of useful tools for game development, we wanted a service that could more efficiently use the power available, on any system. This also tied in with the idea that we wanted to host this game online, in some variety. Because of this, we looked into other possible libraries offered in Python, eventually ending with a decision between pygame and pyglet. While pygame was useful, it did not allow us to use more of the hardware resources available, using SGL as a rendering service. Pyglet seemed like a better option because it offered OpenGL for rendering and also had excellent compatibility with other libraries, such as kytten for GUI. Eventually, we decided on pyglet and plan on using that for future development.<br><br>
						</p>
						<h2>Data Structure</h2>
						<p>
							We are splitting our code into classes. Each of these classes have functions that control attributes of the class.<br>
							We plan on working on each class separately and then putting them together into a larger file. Thankfully we have naming conventions so this should minimize the errors when bringing the code together. Each of these classes will control a different section of the game. So far we have controller, player character, view, and model. Each of these have functions that manipulate internal attributes.<br><br>
						</p>
						<h2>Development Plan</h2>
						<p>
							Having a team of five members, while sometimes difficult, is good from the perspective of work. Because we are using a class system for the code, we can break all parts into separate sections and each student can work on them individually. This results in getting quite a lot of work done because it can be spread throughout multiple people. Going forward though, it seems that we will be partner coding with another member of the team as often as possible. Also, to better compile everything together at the end, we established a naming convention. For a quick example, <br>
							Class: Olin_Cats<br>
							Instance: GeorgeMcFarlane<br>
							Function: eats_soup()<br>
							Variable: bananasToEat<br>
							With this, we can easily interface with other team members and there isn't as much of a divide.

							<h2>The Project</h2>
							<p>We plan to create a 2D video game with a basic AI. AI in this context may be the player's "allies" and the enemies, which would be able to navigate the environment, attack, and enhance the game experience through interaction with the player. This also could include the enemies attacking in new patterns after "learning" the player's fighting strategy. We would like our video game to have a dynamic storyline, where playing the game a second time might result in a completely new experience, with multiple endings that get harder as the player progresses through the story.  Our minimum deliverable would be a functional game with an AI component. In essence, we want a user to enjoy the game and have fun, but we would still like to be able to add more features down the road. Once our minimum deliverable is finished, we plan to make our game available online, have a dynamic storyline, and enhance the game experience with art/sound. Because of the team size, there are quite a few components that will be dealt with in subteams. This includes, but is not currently limited to, building a custom website, having player models and environment graphics, original game mechanics such as fighting, adaptive storyline influenced by the user’s decisions, and AI companions and enemies that would make the game more difficult. This would be quite a lot of work, so splitting it would help keep everything manageable and teach the group how to properly interface with one another so the code can be easily integrated together.</p><br>

							<h2>The Current Status</h2>
							<p>At the moment, we have a basic, top-down video game. The user controls the character's movement through the arrow keys or WASD and the mouse is used for character orientation. With this, moving around the level is fairly straightforward and does not require any special instructions for a new user. When the game starts, the character is in the "home" chunk, where they can find crew members and a fireplace, which signifies home. Everyone is friendly, and clicking on one will bring up a menu of actions, including talking, foraging, and hunting. If you click on an action, the ally will dissappear, performing that action. Clicking on the fireplace will bring up a sleep option, which transitions the game to the next day. If any previous allies were away doing an action, they will return and the found supplies will be added to your inventory. Moving into other chunks, the character may encounter trees, which are great for supplies, or enemies, which attack the player if it gets too close. Luckily, the player is armed with two randomly generated weapons at the start of every game, with different effects each. From this point, we need to develop more variation in the enemies, level design, and implement the storyline.</p><br>
