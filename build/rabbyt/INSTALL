Quick answer
------------

run "easy_install Rabbyt"

On windows you can also grab the installer from the cheeseshop__.

Compiling from source
---------------------

If for some reason easy_install doesn't work, or you just don't want to use it,
you can compile from source.  You will need the following:

  * setuptools
  * A c compiler (such as gcc or mingw)
  * Python development headers
  * Opengl development headers (gl.h and glu.h)

Run "python setup.py install" to build and install it.  (You will need write
permisions for the installation location.)


Compiling on Windows
--------------------

Hopefully you won't need to do this.  I'm just writing some notes here for my
own reference.

 1. Install python2.5, and mingw

 2. Make sure that the python and mingw binaries are on the system PATH.
    (Change it at My Computer(right click)->Properties->Advanced->Environment
    Variables ... reopen the command prompt for changes to take effect.)

 3. Build rabbyt with "python setup.py build -c mingw32"

 4. Run "python setup.py bdist_egg" and "python setup.py bdist_wininst" to make
    the egg and installer.
