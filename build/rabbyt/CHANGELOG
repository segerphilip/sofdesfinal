Version 0.8.3
-------------

* Fixed Sprite.left (etc.) incorrectly applying independant axis scaling to
  absolute coords instead of rotated relative to the sprite.

* Sprite.bounding_radius now reflects Sprite.scale.  (previously ignored.)

* Fixed a segfault when anims have circular dependencies.

* Optimized ``swizzle``.

* Fixed ``aabb_collide()`` not always reporting immediately overlapping rects.

* Fixed a memory leak caused by an extra underscore at the end of ``__dealloc___``

Version 0.8.2
-------------

* Removed deprecated fonts and vertexarrays modules.

* Fixed various problems with the Quad class's properties.

* Fixed problems compiling with new versions of pyrex.

Version 0.8.1
-------------

* Added ``collide_groups()``, ``aabb_collide_groups()``,
  and ``aabb_collide_single()`` functions.

* Fixed using sequences of anims with ``chain``.

* Fixed a potential segmentation fault when aabb_collide is given invalid rects.

* Added support for unary operators to anims.


Version 0.8
-----------

* The ``anims`` module has been rewritten with various new functionality,
  including:

    + You can now use anims with your own classes by subclassing ``Animable``.

    + Added ``ease``, ``ease_in``, and ``ease_out`` anims.

    + Added support for chaining anims sequentially without using a scheduler.

    + ``AnimPointer`` added for reading from a memory address.

    + ``start`` and ``end`` argments for ``lerp`` etc. can now be anims.

* Added ``aabb_collide()`` function for doing bounding box collision.

* Removed the ``chipmunkglue`` module -- it's no longer needed for integrating
  with chipmunk.  (See the example for the new way to do it using
  ``AnimPointer``.)

* ``__import__()`` is now used for importing pyglet and pygame, so blacklists
  aren't needed for tools like py2exe.

* Deprecated ``init_display`` function.

* Deprecated ``fonts`` module and ``vertexarrays`` module.

* Windows binaries are finally compiled with -O3.  (I found the troublesome 
  optimization.)

Version 0.7.6
-------------

* Added ``pyglet_load_texture`` for using pyglet instead of pygame.  (Which one
  to use is autodetected.)

* Added ``Sprite.texture`` property, which accepts pyglet textures as well
  as filenames.

* Assigning a 12-tuple to ``Sprite.tex_shape`` is now converted from the
  format used by pyglet's ``tex_coords`` texture attribute.

* Added ``Quad`` class, to make ``Sprite.shape`` and ``Sprite.tex_shape``
  nicer.

* Added a workaround to make setuptools work with Pyrex 0.9.6.3.

* Added ``collide_single()`` function for finding collisions between a group
  and a single object.

* Fixed a bug where the time arguments in ``lerp`` were converted to ints.

* Removed deprecated ``physics`` module.

* Various other bugfixes.

Version 0.7.5
-------------

* New (alpha) Array classes.

* Fixed a segmentation fault due to weakrefs.  (``Sprite`` instances are no
  longer weakrefable.)

* Fixed sine interpolation being cosine interpolation :-P

* Added an example showing different interpolators.

* Added a ``flags`` keyword argument to ``init_display()``

Version 0.7
-----------

* License changed to MIT.

* Added add_time() function.

* Time is stored internally as ``float`` instead of ``int``.  This allows for
  optionally using seconds instead of milliseconds.

* Added exponential, cosine, and sine interpolation.

* Documented rabbyt.anims__ quite a bit better.

__ http://matthewmarshall.org/projects/rabbyt/docs/rabbyt/anims/

* Forced Pyrex version 0.9.5 or greater, to prevent segfaults when using
  weakrefs.  (It still can be compiled without pyrex.)

* Added more hacks for building on MacOS.  Hopefully it'll all go smooth now.

* Deprecated the Basic1 and Basic2 physics classes.

* HTML documentation is now included in the source distribution.

* Added missing documentation for ``VertexArray.texture_id``.

Version 0.6
-----------

* Sprites can be scaled independently on their x and y axes.

* Added left, right, top, and bottom properties to Sprite.

* Fixed bug with some sprites being drawn upside-down when rotated.

* Fixed c, pyx, and pxd files being installed.

* Added a small function for integrating with the chipmunk/pymunk physics lib.

Version 0.0.5
-------------

* c source files are included, so Pyrex is not needed for building.

* Renamed the ``DV``\* classes to ``Anim``\*.  (This is mostly internal and
  shouldn't affect anyone.)

* MANY fixes and improvements to font rendering.  (As in, it's actually
  useful now!)

* Lots of docstrings added and improved.

* ``pygame_load_texture()`` now takes ``filter`` and ``mipmap`` arguments,
  which are passed on to ``load_texture()``.

Version 0.0.4
-------------

* Fixed compiling on MS Windows.

* Added some simple helpers for physics simulation.

* Moved all non-rendering code out of ``Sprite`` and into ``BaseSprite``.

* Added font rendering support.

* Using color data in ``VertexArray`` rendering is now optional.

* ``VertexArray`` can now optionally bind a texture before rendering.

* Fixed a bug with ``VertexArray`` barfing when not given all the data for
  a vertex, instead of using defaults.

* Fixed a segfault when trying to load a texture before initializing the
  OpenGL context.

* Switched ``DVProxy`` and ``DVPyFunc`` to not cache by default.  (Premature
  optimization is the root of all evil.)

* All examples now respond to window events nicely.


Version 0.0.3
-------------

* Added ``DVProxy`` and ``DVPyFunc`` classes.  (Assigning a function to a sprite
  property creates a ``DVPyFunc`` transparently.)

* Added basic arithmetic operations for DV classes.

* Added ``Sprite.attrgetter()`` for super fast property access.

* Changed ``rabbyt.collisions.rdc()`` to not return groups with only one object.

* Added a number of introductory examples, showing the basic features.

Version 0.0.2
-------------

* Added vertex array rendering.

* Added collision detection.

* Lots of docstrings added/improved.

* Added ``rgb`` property to ``Sprite``.

Version 0.0.1
-------------

* Initial release!
