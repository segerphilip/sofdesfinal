General idea seems to be a top down, almost map like area where the main "explorer" walks around for supplies/food/enemies. Possibilities for top down:
	New area where you have to navigate a randomly generated maze
	New area randomly generated with monsters

Have a main "family" you need to protect/feed/shelter. The main character (you) has to get the supplies necessary. 
Random outcomes from different events, resulting in either profit or damage to your team/character.
